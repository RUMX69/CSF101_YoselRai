Practical 4 Documentation & Reflection
Instructions
For this practical, we were required to:

Implement a singly linked list from scratch in Python, including node creation, appending, inserting at a specific position, deleting by value, searching for a value, reversing the list, and displaying the list.
Solve advanced linked list problems:
Merge two sorted linked lists into a single sorted list.
Remove the nth node from the end of a linked list using an efficient algorithm.
Reverse a linked list, both in-place and using a class-based approach.
Use object-oriented programming principles to encapsulate linked list behaviors.
Write and run test code to demonstrate and verify each operation.

Reflection
What I Learned
Deepened my understanding of how linked lists work and how to manipulate nodes and pointers to perform various operations.
Learned to solve more complex linked list problems using efficient algorithms, such as the two-pointer technique for removing nodes from the end.
Improved my skills in object-oriented programming by designing and implementing classes for linked lists and nodes.
Gained experience in writing modular, reusable code and testing each function thoroughly.
Challenges Faced and How I Overcame Them
Pointer Manipulation Errors:
Initially, I made mistakes with pointer assignments, especially when reversing the list or inserting/deleting nodes at specific positions. I overcame this by drawing diagrams and stepping through the code with print statements to visualize the changes in the list structure.

Edge Cases:
Faced challenges handling edge cases, such as deleting the head node, inserting at the beginning or end, and working with empty lists. Careful testing and adding conditional checks helped resolve these issues.

Class Design Issues:
In the ReverseLinkedList.py file, I initially confused the node value with the head pointer in the class design. I fixed this by reviewing the logic and ensuring the class attributes correctly represented the list structure.

Debugging and Testing:
Some functions did not work as expected on the first try. I used systematic debugging, added print statements, and tested with various inputs to identify and fix bugs.

This practical significantly improved my understanding of linked lists and their operations. The process of implementing, testing, and debugging each function helped reinforce key programming concepts and prepared me for more advanced data structure challenges.
