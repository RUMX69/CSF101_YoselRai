Practical 1 Reflection
Instructions
For this practical, we were required to:

Explore and implement Python basics, including numbers, strings, booleans, and type conversion.
Practice using operators (arithmetic, assignment, comparison, logical).
Apply control structures such as conditionals, loops, and control statements (break, continue).
Write and use functions, understand parameters, return values, recursion, and variable scope.
Work with data structures like lists and dictionaries.
Perform file operations (reading/writing text and binary files, file management).
Develop algorithmic thinking by creating flowcharts and pseudocode before coding.
Each topic was divided into sub-tasks, and we were expected to write Python scripts for each, test them, and reflect on the learning process.

Solutions
Basics
numbers.py: Demonstrated integer and float operations, type casting, and basic math functions.
strings.py: Showed string creation, concatenation, slicing, and formatting.
booleans.py: Used boolean values in expressions and logical operations.
type_conversion.py: Converted between types (int, float, str, bool) and handled conversion errors.
Operators
arithmetic.py: Used addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulus, exponentiation, and floor division.
assignment.py: Applied assignment operators (=, +=, -=, etc.).
comparison.py: Compared values using ==, !=, <, >, <=, >=.
logical.py: Combined conditions using and, or, not.
Control Structures
conditionals.py: Wrote if, elif, else statements for decision making.
loops.py: Used for and while loops to iterate over sequences and ranges.
break_continue.py: Demonstrated breaking out of loops and skipping iterations.
Functions and Scope
basic_functions.py: Defined and called simple functions.
parameters_and_returns.py: Used parameters and return values in functions.
recursion.py: Implemented recursive solutions (e.g., factorial, Fibonacci).
scope.py: Explored local and global variable scope.
Data Structures
lists.py: Created, modified, and iterated through lists; performed slicing and sorting.
dictionaries.py: Created dictionaries, accessed/modified key-value pairs, iterated through items.
File Operations
text_files.py: Read from and wrote to text files, handled file modes and exceptions.
binary_files.py: Worked with binary files for reading and writing data.
file_management.py: Checked file existence, deleted files, and managed file paths.
FlowChart & Pseudocode
Created flowcharts and pseudocode for selected problems before implementing them in Python, which helped clarify logic and structure.

What I Learned
Comprehensive Python Foundations:
I gained a thorough understanding of Python’s syntax and core programming concepts, including data types, operators, control structures, and functions.
Problem Decomposition:
Learned to break down complex problems into smaller, manageable tasks, making them easier to solve and debug.
Algorithmic Thinking:
Practiced planning solutions using flowcharts and pseudocode, which improved my logical thinking and made coding more efficient.
Practical File Handling:
Understood how to work with files in Python, including handling errors and managing resources safely.
Data Structure Mastery:
Became comfortable using lists and dictionaries for various data manipulation tasks.
Challenges Faced
Debugging Logic Errors:
Sometimes, loops or conditionals did not behave as expected. I overcame this by using print statements and the VS Code debugger to trace variable values and program flow.
Recursion:
Initially struggled with recursive functions, especially understanding base cases and the call stack. Drawing diagrams and stepping through code helped me master recursion.
File Path Issues:
Encountered errors due to incorrect file paths or missing files. I learned to use exception handling and always check file existence before operations.
Scope Confusion:
Faced issues with variable scope, especially when modifying global variables inside functions. Reviewing scope rules and practicing examples clarified these concepts.
How I Overcame Challenges
Used online documentation, tutorials, and peer discussions to clarify doubts.
Practiced writing small code snippets to test new concepts before integrating them into larger scripts.
Regularly reviewed and refactored my code for better readability and efficiency.
Used the VS Code debugger and print statements to trace and fix errors.
This practical has greatly improved my confidence in Python programming and problem-solving. The systematic approach of planning, implementing, and debugging will be invaluable as I move on to more advanced topics and real-world projects.
