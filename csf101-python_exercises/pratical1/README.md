# Practical 1 Documentation & Reflection

## a) Documentation

### Main Concepts Applied

#### Python Basics
Explored fundamental data types such as numbers (integers, floats), strings, and booleans. Practiced type conversion between these types and performed basic arithmetic and string operations. Learned how to use built-in functions for manipulating and formatting data.

#### Control Structures
Applied conditional statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`) to control the flow of programs based on logical conditions. Utilized different types of loops (`for`, `while`) to iterate over sequences and perform repeated actions. Implemented control statements like `break` and `continue` to manage loop execution and handle special cases within iterations.

#### Functions and Scope
Defined reusable blocks of code using functions, with and without parameters. Explored how to return values from functions and how to use default arguments. Gained an understanding of variable scope, distinguishing between local and global variables, and learned how recursion works by implementing recursive functions for problems like factorial and Fibonacci sequences.

#### Data Structures
Worked extensively with lists and dictionaries. Learned how to create, access, modify, and delete elements in lists and dictionaries. Practiced common operations such as sorting, slicing, and iterating through these data structures. Understood the use cases for each and how to choose the appropriate structure for a given problem.

#### File Operations
Practiced reading from and writing to text and binary files. Learned how to open files in different modes, handle file paths, and manage file resources using context managers (`with` statement). Explored file management tasks such as checking for file existence, appending data, and handling exceptions during file operations.

#### Algorithmic Thinking
Developed step-by-step solutions for problems using flowcharts and pseudocode before implementing them in Python. This helped in planning the logic and structure of the code more effectively.

## b) Reflection

### What I Learned
- Developed a solid understanding of Python syntax and the core principles of programming, including how to break down problems into smaller, manageable parts.
- Improved my ability to write clean, modular code by using functions and organizing logic into reusable components.
- Gained practical experience with Python’s built-in data structures, which are essential for efficient data manipulation and storage.
- Learned the importance of planning code using flowcharts and pseudocode, which made the implementation phase smoother and reduced errors.
- Became comfortable with file input/output operations, which are crucial for many real-world applications such as data processing and persistence.

### Challenges Faced

#### Understanding Recursion
Initially, recursion was difficult to grasp, especially in terms of visualizing the call stack and base cases. I overcame this by drawing flowcharts, tracing recursive calls manually, and using the VS Code debugger to step through recursive functions line by line.

#### File Handling Errors
Encountered issues when trying to read from or write to files that did not exist, or when file paths were incorrect. I learned to use exception handling (`try-except` blocks) to catch and handle these errors gracefully, and to always check file paths before performing operations.

#### Debugging Logic in Loops and Conditionals
Sometimes, loops would not terminate as expected or conditionals would not produce the correct results. I used print statements to inspect variable values at different stages and leveraged the VS Code debugger to set breakpoints and watch expressions, which helped me identify and fix logical errors.

#### Managing Variable Scope
Faced confusion when variables inside functions did not behave as expected due to scope issues. This was resolved by reviewing the rules of local and global scope and practicing with examples to reinforce the concepts.

#### Algorithm Design
Translating flowcharts and pseudocode into working Python code was sometimes challenging, especially for more complex problems. I learned to break down the logic into smaller steps and test each part incrementally.

### Overcoming Challenges
- Used online resources, documentation, and discussion with peers to clarify doubts and learn best practices.
- Practiced writing and testing small code snippets to understand new concepts before integrating them into larger programs.
- Regularly reviewed and refactored code to improve readability and efficiency.

This practical has significantly enhanced my confidence in Python programming and problem-solving. I now feel more prepared to tackle more advanced topics and real-world projects using Python. The systematic approach of planning, implementing, and debugging has proven invaluable and will guide my future learning and development.
